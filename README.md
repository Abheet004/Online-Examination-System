# Online Examination System 📝

## 📖 Project Overview
[cite_start]This project aims to develop a web-based application for automating the inventory management process[cite: 12]. [cite_start]It addresses the growing need for automating the examination process and proposes a solution in the form of a digital platform for conducting assessments[cite: 13].

[cite_start]The expected outcomes include an improved system, increased efficiency in grading, and cost savings compared to traditional paper-based exams[cite: 14].

## 🎯 Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
* [cite_start]To analyse the requirements and constraints of the current system[cite: 17].
* [cite_start]To design and develop an efficient solution addressing these requirements[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]To implement the solution in stages and evaluate its effectiveness[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]To test the system and refine it based on feedback[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]To achieve the projected results within the given timeline[cite: 21].

## scope 🔍
The scope of this project includes:
* [cite_start]Conducting a thorough literature survey to identify existing systems and technologies[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]Performing requirement analysis to understand user needs and system specifications[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]Developing system designs, including architecture and module breakdown[cite: 26].
* [cite_start]Implementing the system based on approved designs[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]Testing and validating the solution against requirements[cite: 28].
* [cite_start]Documenting and presenting the final deliverable[cite: 29].

## ⚙️ Project Modules & Development Phases
[cite_start]The project is divided into five key modules, each with specific objectives and deliverables[cite: 31]:

### [cite_start]1. Requirement Analysis [cite: 32]
* [cite_start]**Objective:** Gather and analyse system requirements to meet end-user and stakeholder needs[cite: 33].
* [cite_start]**Key Tasks:** Stakeholder interviews, technology review, and documenting functional/non-functional requirements[cite: 35, 36, 37].
* [cite_start]**Deliverable:** Requirement Analysis Document[cite: 40].

### [cite_start]2. System Design [cite: 41]
* [cite_start]**Objective:** Design system architecture and individual modules based on gathered requirements[cite: 42].
* [cite_start]**Key Tasks:** Developing flow diagrams, database schema, UI design, and module breakdown[cite: 44, 45, 46].
* [cite_start]**Deliverable:** System Design Document[cite: 49].

### [cite_start]3. Implementation [cite: 50]
* [cite_start]**Objective:** Implement the system based on the approved design[cite: 51].
* [cite_start]**Key Tasks:** Coding individual modules, system integration, unit testing, and debugging[cite: 53, 54, 55, 56].
* [cite_start]**Deliverable:** Working prototype of the system[cite: 58].

### [cite_start]4. Testing and Evaluation [cite: 59]
* [cite_start]**Objective:** Test the developed system to ensure it meets specified requirements[cite: 60].
* [cite_start]**Key Tasks:** System testing, User Acceptance Testing (UAT), and bug fixing[cite: 62, 63, 64].
* [cite_start]**Deliverable:** Test Report and Performance Evaluation[cite: 66, 67].

### [cite_start]5. Documentation and Final Report [cite: 68]
* [cite_start]**Objective:** Compile all work into a final report and documentation[cite: 69].
* [cite_start]**Key Tasks:** Detailed documentation of design/implementation and final report preparation[cite: 71, 72].
* [cite_start]**Deliverable:** Final Project Report and User Manual[cite: 75, 76].
